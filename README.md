# Abstract

Most of our power requirements are fulfilled by coal-fired power plants. This paper aims to improve its efficiency by designing a Fractional Order Proportional Derivative Controller (FOPD). A mathematical model is developed from the real-time data from the fossil-fueled power plant in Tuticorin India. The optimal tuning parameters for the FOPD controller are chosen from a selection of widely popular Optimization Algorithms (OA) [Sine Cosine OA (SCOA), Ant Lion OA (ALOA), Moth Flame OA (MFOA), and Whale OA (WOA)]. The analysis evaluates the controller's performance with time domain specifications like settling time, undershoots, and overshoots, and the superiority is highlighted. The operational efficiency of the power plant is evaluated against The efficiency values were calculated by the proposed controller using various OAs. The plant's operational efficiency is determined to be 37.2%. An increase in efficiency of 23.5% is achieved while using the intelligent controllers. Improvement in efficiency is also highlighted.
